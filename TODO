ALL:
* Do page setup i C-code instead, asm is too crappy to read


BOOT:



KERNEL:
* Clean up interrupt handling (replace stack, push regs etc., maybe with TSS)
* Implement and test a system call.
* Memory management (in kernel or not?)


INTERRUPTS/EXCEPTIONS:
* Own TSS and TSS-descriptor in GDT for each hardware interrrupt
* Reserve own stack for each of them, and only use 'automatic' variables.
  (This will give reentrant code)
* Each TSS will only point to a stub and calls the master interrupt decode 
  function, this function will send a signal to the device driver that has registered
  the handler or call the handler directly (don't know yet)




Steps:
1. Implement a system call and test.
2. Run a task in separate address space.
